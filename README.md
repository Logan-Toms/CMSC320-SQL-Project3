# CMSC320-SQL-Project3

## Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and my ability to design, manage, and query databases. This coursework is part of my  Relational Database Concepts and Applications (CMSC 320) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To design and create database tables using SQL.
- To perform data insertion, updating, and deletion operations.
- To execute various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- To understand and apply relational database concepts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Database Design**: Structuring databases to efficiently store and retrieve data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Writing and executing complex SQL statements for various operations including joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Data Manipulation**: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage database records effectively.
- **Problem Solving**: Crafting queries to solve real-world data retrieval and analysis problems.
- **Database Management**: Creating, modifying, and dropping tables and other database objects to maintain database integrity and performance.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Develop Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my understanding of database management.
- **Improve Efficiency**: Learned to write optimized queries for faster data retrieval.
- **Understand Data Relationships**: Gained a deeper understanding of how data is interconnected and how to leverage relationships in querying.

## Files Included
- `Toms_CREATE_table.sql`: SQL script for creating database tables.
- `Toms_DROP_table.sql`: SQL script for dropping database tables.
- `Toms_INSERT_data.sql`: SQL script for inserting data into tables.
- `Toms_Query_data.sql`: SQL script for querying data from tables.

## Usage Instructions
To use these scripts, you can run them in your SQL environment (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). Below are the general steps:

1. **Create Tables**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_CREATE_table.sql;
    ```

2. **Insert Data**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_INSERT_data.sql;
    ```

3. **Query Data**:
    ```sql
    source Toms_Query_data.sql;
    ```

4. **Drop Tables** (if needed):
    ```sql
    source Toms_DROP_table.sql;
    ```

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for database operations.
